# Goldman-Sachs-Virtual-Engineering-Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains the tasks and findings for the Goldman Sachs Virtual Engineering Simulation. The primary objective is to analyze and crack passwords using available tools, understand password protection mechanisms, and propose policy improvements for enhanced security.

### Task Instructions

1. **Gain Background Knowledge**  
   - Review the links provided in the additional resources section (below) to understand password cracking methods and best practices to enhance the efficiency.
   
2. **Crack Passwords**  
   - Utilize tools such as Hashcat to attempt cracking the passwords provided in the `password_dump` file.

3. **Assess Password Security**  
   - Analyze the following aspects of the passwords:
     - Type of hashing algorithm used
     - Level of protection offered by the hashing algorithm
     - Possible security controls to strengthen the system
     - Current password policies
     - Suggested changes to improve the password policy

4. **Draft Findings**  
   - Prepare a one-page email/memo summarizing:
     - The vulnerabilities identified
     - Proposed security enhancements
     - Controls the organization should implement for better password protection  
   - Keep this memo concise, aiming to complete it within 1.5 hours.

### Certificate of Completion
